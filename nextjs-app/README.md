ISSUE: The d/w column for the last transaction is showing the duplicate of balance.

DESCRIPTION: As I am taking the difference of current balance with the previous balance in order to get d/w, which in result raising this issue

PATH: utils/icici-bank.js
STEPS: Just refresh the current window and scroll to the bottom. Also this issue is happenning when the date based filter is applied as by default the oldest transaction shows only the balance at that instance.
